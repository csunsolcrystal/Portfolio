# Welcome to Sol's Portolio! 

This portfolio will contain information about my knowledge involving Computer Information Technology. Many of these projects that I have worked on are from school or personal projects. Many of the school projects involved recreating projects in a real-world scenario such as consultation for a company, system design, and network design.

## School Projects

*   Consultation system design for e-commerce
*   Consultation network designs for Use-case scenarios
*   Active Directory for a client-server network
*   Conceptual and Logical Database design
*   Basic web-development using LAMP
*   Prototyping context-awareness software design
*   Risk Factor Assessement
*   Information Technology architectural design using virtualization

## Personal Projects

*   Software client for a major popular MMORPG game
*   AHK (Auto Hot Key) script using 3rd party software that converts images/documents/non-text into text characters
*   Home lab setup using virtualization

### Consultation System Design for eCommerce

> Project Timeline: August 2017 - December 2017
>
> This semester long group project involved creating a system design for the company American Vision Windows. In our research, we realized that the company lacked an e-commerce environment and account recievables issue. To solve this issue, we worked on a system design that allows customers and employees to keep track of transactions online. In this document, it contains methodical diagrams such as DFD (Data-flow diagrams) and ERD (Entity-Relation Diagrams).

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
